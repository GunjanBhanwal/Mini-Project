# Mini-Project
Our 3rd-semester mini project TalkScrite, crafted by me and my teammate Prachi Sah, aims to be a comprehensive communication hub. Currently featuring a language translator, text-to-speech converter, word counter, and a synonym-providing dictionary, our project is highly versatile. With room for expansion, it offers a one-stop solution for diverse communication tasks. Check out our GitHub repository for a transformative communication experience.
